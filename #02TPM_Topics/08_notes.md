🧠 LLM Architecture
1. Explain the self-attention mechanism and its role

What:
Self-attention allows a model to weigh the importance of different words in an input sequence relative to each other. It enables each token to look at all other tokens when generating a representation.

Why it’s crucial:

    Captures long-range dependencies

    Enables context awareness

    Fundamental to Transformer models

Use Case:
In a legal document summarization LLM, self-attention helps relate references from different sections, like linking a clause in section 2.1 to a definition in section 10.
2. How to handle context length limitations in LLMs?

Techniques:

    Chunking + Sliding Windows: Split long documents and retain overlap

    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Fetch only relevant context

    Long-context models: Use Claude 2, Gemini 1.5, Mistral Long, or GPT-4o with extended token support

    External memory / chunk-based stateful agents: Store intermediate memory off-model

Use Case:
In an LLM-based contract analysis tool, break the contract into logical sections, retrieve only relevant parts for analysis, and preserve references using chunk IDs.
3. Compare transformer architectures: Encoder-only, Decoder-only, Encoder-Decoder
Architecture	Examples	Use Cases
Encoder-only	BERT	Classification, embeddings, QA (no gen)
Decoder-only	GPT, LLaMA, Claude	Autoregressive text generation
Encoder-decoder	T5, FLAN-T5, Gemini	Summarization, translation, seq2seq tasks

Use Case:

    Use T5 for summarization pipelines

    Use GPT-4 for code generation agents

    Use BERT for customer intent classification

🧪 Evaluation & Testing
4. How do you measure hallucination in LLM outputs?

Approaches:

    Factuality scoring: Compare against a ground truth (e.g., factual QA datasets)

    Attribution metrics: Use RAG to trace output to source documents

    Human evaluation: Domain experts verify correctness

    Retrieval grounding check: Check if outputs reflect retrieved context

Use Case:
In a financial report generator, outputs must only use SEC filings — use attribution scores to reject hallucinated numbers.
5. Design a test suite for a multi-step reasoning LLM

Components:

    Task decomposition testing (e.g., math → reasoning → final answer)

    Chain-of-thought prompt validation

    Intermediate step consistency

    Evaluation metrics: Step-wise accuracy, pass@k, execution trace validation

Use Case:
Testing a tax calculator chatbot that needs to (1) classify income, (2) apply local tax rules, and (3) provide deduction — all steps must be verifiable.
6. How do you detect and mitigate model bias?

Detection:

    Run adversarial audits using bias-focused datasets (e.g., StereoSet, BBQ)

    Check output divergence across demographic groups

    Use embedding clustering for representation skew

Mitigation:

    Debiasing fine-tunes

    Reweight training samples

    Prompt templating with neutral language

    RLHF tuning with fairness constraints

Use Case:
For an HR assistant LLM, ensure equal performance on resume parsing across names/regions by measuring outcome differences and tuning training data distribution.
🏗️ System Design
7. Design a real-time LLM API with 99.9% uptime

Key Components:

    Load-balanced microservice API layer

    Auto-scaling LLM inference backends (e.g., GPU pods on K8s)

    Fallback strategy (cached outputs or smaller backup model)

    Observability: latency, token usage, error rate

    Redundancy: multi-zone or multi-region deployment

Use Case:
An e-commerce chatbot using LLM for live support must auto-scale during flash sales. Combine OpenAI + in-house fallback with caching on Redis.
8. How would you implement load balancing across multiple LLM providers?

Techniques:

    Provider abstraction layer (LangChain, or custom orchestrator)

    Scoring-based routing (e.g., use cheaper model if confidence > threshold)

    Quotas-aware routing (track token usage to avoid rate limits)

    Geo-routing: Route by region latency

Use Case:
A global summarization API chooses between Claude for longer context, GPT-4 for quality, or LLaMA2 for cheaper requests, based on SLA and token budget.
9. What’s your rate-limiting strategy for LLM APIs?

Approaches:

    Per-user token budget

    Burst + sustained request throttling (leaky bucket)

    Priority queues: Premium vs. free users

    Exponential backoff + retry

    Circuit breakers for error spikes

Use Case:
For an LLM research dashboard, enforce per-user quotas to prevent DoS, and implement backoff with warning messages in frontend.
🧭 Program Management
10. How do you estimate timelines for experimental AI projects?

Framework:

    Break into phases: POC → Pilot → Prod

    Timebox experiments (e.g., 1 week for prompt tuning)

    Use tech maturity to adjust uncertainty buffer

    Add margin for human-in-the-loop time

Use Case:
You’re building a customer query router — allocate 2 weeks for prompt/PDF tuning, 3 weeks for automation integration, 1 week for eval tuning.
11. How to manage ML/LLM tech debt?

Sources:

    Reused prompts with outdated logic

    Models not version-tracked

    Fragile eval pipelines

Strategies:

    Refactor prompts with templating engine

    Introduce Git-based model registry (e.g., DVC)

    Schedule debt reviews in retrospectives

    Use evals-as-code to validate changes

Use Case:
Refactor prompt chains in a product classifier where templates are scattered and hard to test — consolidate and version with tests in CI.
12. How do you handle scope creep in fuzzy AI projects?

Strategies:

    Set clear acceptance criteria and evaluation metrics at kick-off

    Freeze scope after pilot unless retriaged

    Educate stakeholders about model uncertainty boundaries

    Propose experimentation budgets

Use Case:
In a content moderation LLM project, stakeholders kept expanding categories. Add scope guardrails and offer phased additions after evaluation.
