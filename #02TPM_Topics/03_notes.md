## üìå 1. LLM-Powered Data Systems

### ‚úÖ Core Understanding

**üîç What are LLMs (Large Language Models)?**
LLMs are **neural network models trained on massive text corpora** to predict the next word in a sequence. They are based on the **Transformer architecture**, which uses:

* **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input for each output token.
* **Autoregressive Generation**: Predicts one token at a time, feeding outputs back into the model.
* **Positional Encoding**: Injects order into token embeddings, as transformers don‚Äôt process sequences sequentially.

**LLM examples**: GPT-4, Claude, PaLM, LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon.

**üß™ Training Process Overview:**

1. **Pretraining**: Trained on large text datasets (e.g., Common Crawl, books, code, Wikipedia) in a self-supervised manner (next token prediction).
2. **Instruction Tuning**: Fine-tuned on human-written instructions (e.g., FLAN dataset) to make responses more useful.
3. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**: Aligns model outputs with human preferences using reinforcement learning, improving helpfulness and reducing toxicity.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Weaknesses:**

* **Hallucinations**: Confidently generating factually incorrect output.
* **Context Drift**: Losing track of context in long conversations.
* **Bias**: Gender, race, cultural bias embedded from pretraining data.
* **Inconsistent Reasoning**: May give contradictory or illogical responses on similar prompts.
