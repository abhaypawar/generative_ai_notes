There are **multiple levels** of adapting an LLM for specific tasks. Each has trade-offs in **complexity, cost, data needs**, and **control**.

---

## 🔹 1. Prompt Engineering
- 🧠 No model change
- ✍️ Just craft better prompts (instructions)
- ✅ Easiest, zero cost
- ❌ Limited control over behavior
- 🔍 Example:  
  - Prompt: "Summarize the following text in bullet points."

---

## 🔹 2. In-Context Learning (Few-shot / Zero-shot)
- 📎 Provide **examples in the prompt itself**
- ✅ Quick and flexible
- ❌ Struggles with very long or complex examples

```text
Instruction: Translate to French  
Example: "Good morning" → "Bonjour"  
Now: "How are you?" → ?
````

---

## 🔹 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* 🔄 Augment model with **external knowledge** (retrieved at runtime)
* ✅ Keeps base model frozen
* ✅ Ideal for keeping LLMs “up to date”
* ❌ Needs retrieval infra (like vector DBs)

```text
User: "What is the current GDP of India?"  
System: Searches online → feeds facts to model → model answers accurately.
```

---

## 🔹 4. Fine-Tuning

* 🧬 Actually **update model weights**
* ✅ High task performance
* ❌ Expensive, data- and compute-heavy
* ✅ Best when task is very specific or sensitive

🛠️ Types:

* **Full fine-tuning** → All weights are updated
* **LoRA / PEFT** → Only small adapter layers are trained (efficient)

---

## 🔹 5. Instruction Tuning

* 📘 Special case of fine-tuning
* ✅ Helps model better follow human instructions
* 🔍 Example: InstructGPT, Alpaca

---

## 🔹 6. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

* 🎯 Train model to prefer outputs humans like
* ✅ Aligns model behavior with human preferences
* ❌ Expensive and complex
* 🧠 Used in: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

## 📊 Summary Table

| Technique           | Model Change? | Cost      | Control   | Notes                         |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Prompt Engineering  | ❌             | Low       | Low       | Great for quick results       |
| In-Context Learning | ❌             | Low       | Medium    | Good for small tasks          |
| RAG                 | ❌ (frozen)    | Medium    | High      | Combines LLM + external data  |
| Fine-Tuning         | ✅             | High      | Very High | Needs labeled data, infra     |
| Instruction Tuning  | ✅             | Medium    | High      | Makes LLM follow instructions |
| RLHF                | ✅             | Very High | Very High | Aligns with human preferences |

## ✅ Recommendation

> Use the **lightest method** that meets your needs.
> Start with **prompt engineering** or **RAG**, move to **fine-tuning** only if necessary.
