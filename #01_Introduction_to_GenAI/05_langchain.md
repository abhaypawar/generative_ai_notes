## 🔧 LangChain

### 🔹 What It Is

LangChain is a **modular framework for building applications with LLMs**, primarily centered around chaining prompts, integrating tools, memory, agents, and more.

### 🔹 Architecture Diagram

```plaintext
  +-------------+      +-------------+      +------------------+
  |   Prompt    | ---> | LLM Wrapper | ---> | Output Parser     |
  +-------------+      +-------------+      +------------------+
         |                        |                       |
         v                        v                       v
  +------------+     +-----------------+         +------------------+
  |  Memory    |     |  Tools (APIs)   |         | Chains / Agents  |
  +------------+     +-----------------+         +------------------+
```

### 🔹 Core Concepts

* **LLM Wrappers** – support for OpenAI, Anthropic, local models (HuggingFace, Ollama)
* **PromptTemplates** – standardized prompt building
* **Chains** – sequences of LLM calls, with logic
* **Tools & Agents** – tools like search, calculator; agents decide what to call
* **Memory** – context retention across runs

### 🔹 Pros

* Very **flexible** and modular
* Huge ecosystem (Tools, Templates, Memory types)
* Works with local + remote models
* Fast to prototype & test

### 🔹 Cons

* **Hard to debug** complex chains
* Stateless by default; needs memory hackery
* Agents can be flaky unless tightly controlled
* Limited support for **real agent collaboration**

### 🔹 Use When

* You want to **build LLM-powered tools, chatbots, assistants** quickly
* You’re exploring different LLM providers
* You need **custom chains or tool integrations**

---

## 🔁 LangGraph

### 🔹 What It Is

LangGraph is a **stateful agent framework** built on top of LangChain, allowing developers to model **LLM workflows as state machines / graphs** with memory and control flow.

### 🔹 Architecture Diagram

```plaintext
     +------------+       Yes       +------------+       +------------+
     |  Node A    |  ------------>  |  Node B    |  --->  |  Node C    |
     +------------+                +------------+       +------------+
          ^  \                          |                     |
         /    \ No                     v                     v
   +------------+              +-------------+         +------------+
   |  Retry or  | <----------- |  Decision   | <-----  |  Output     |
   |   Finish   |              |   Node      |         +------------+
   +------------+              +-------------+
```

### 🔹 Core Concepts

* **Nodes** = agents or toolcalls or logic units
* **Edges** = transitions with logic (conditions)
* **State** = shared memory between all nodes
* **Graph Runtime** = executes node network with memory updates

### 🔹 Pros

* True **multi-agent support** with flow control
* **Stateful orchestration** (retains memory across node calls)
* Better for **retries**, **error handling**, and **control flow**
* Supports **parallel branches**, loops, conditional paths

### 🔹 Cons

* Requires deeper understanding of stateful programming
* Debugging graphs can be non-trivial
* Still evolving in ecosystem/tools/docs

### 🔹 Use When

* You need **multi-step, multi-agent workflows**
* Your app logic involves **conditional execution**
* You want **postmortem / remediation / RAG workflows** with control

## 🧠 CrewAI (Also: AutoGen, OpenAgents)

### 🔹 What It Is

CrewAI and AutoGen are **agent collaboration frameworks**, where each agent has a role (writer, planner, researcher), and they interact autonomously to complete tasks.

### 🔹 Architecture Overview

```plaintext
+-------------+       +-----------------+       +------------------+
| Researcher  | <---> |   Coordinator   | <---> | Coder / Writer   |
+-------------+       +-----------------+       +------------------+
          ^                                           |
          |                                           v
     +----------+                             +------------------+
     |   User   |                             | External Tools   |
     +----------+                             +------------------+
```

### 🔹 Core Concepts

* **Agents with roles & goals**
* **Coordinator / Supervisor** manages task delegation
* Can have persistent memory & self-correction
* Tools + LLMs integrated in each agent

### 🔹 Pros

* Natural fit for **autonomous LLM systems**
* Excellent for **delegating subtasks**
* Growing support for team-like setups (CodeGen + Review)

### 🔹 Cons

* Less predictable; needs **guardrails**
* Sometimes overkill for simple workflows
* Requires **cost control** for multi-agent runs

### 🔹 Use When

* You want to simulate **collaborating experts**
* Building **complex task automation** like report writing
* Multi-agent conversations like **simulated podcasts or debates**

## 📚 Haystack (deepset)

### 🔹 What It Is

A **RAG-centric framework** for production search + LLM pipelines. It abstracts document stores, retrievers, rankers, readers, and LLM integrations.

### 🔹 Architecture Diagram

```plaintext
+-----------+     +-------------+     +-----------------+
| Document  | --> | Retriever   | --> | Reader / LLM    |
| Store     |     | (BM25/DR)   |     | (QA Generator)  |
+-----------+     +-------------+     +-----------------+
                            |
                            v
                    +-----------------+
                    | Prompt Builder  |
                    +-----------------+
```

### 🔹 Pros

* **Enterprise-ready** RAG pipelines
* Works with **Elastic, FAISS, Weaviate**
* Modular: plug in LLMs, retrievers, etc.
* Good for **search-first** LLM apps

### 🔹 Cons

* Less agent/control flow capability
* Focused on RAG — not general-purpose LLM orchestration

### 🔹 Use When

* You’re building a **search-enhanced LLM app**
* RAG pipelines with vector DBs + evaluators
* Enterprise NLP use cases (internal QA, legal search)

### 2. **Agent Design Patterns**

| Pattern                               | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Planner-Executor Pattern** | One agent decomposes tasks (“Find top 3 GPUs”), another executes each subtask. Used in CrewAI & LangGraph.                                                          |
| 🔁 **Critic-Refiner Loop**            | One agent generates output, another evaluates it (against rubric/goal), and either refines or accepts. Used in coding assistants.                                   |
| 🧠 **Memory-Fused Agents**            | Agents share a centralized vector memory or key-value context store, allowing persistence across tasks and teams.                                                   |
| 🧪 **Self-Evaluating Agents**         | Agents use tools like `score_prompt_quality()` or `validate_output_against_spec()` for autonomous QA.                                                               |
| 🛠️ **Tool-First Agent Routing**      | Incoming tasks are classified, and the correct agent is selected to run (e.g., billing agent vs. support agent). Can be implemented using LangGraph edges + guards. |

### 3. **LangGraph Deep Industry Use**

#### 🎯 **Case: RCA + Postmortem Generator (SRE)**

**Flow:**

```
[Log Collector] → [Log Summarizer] 
                → [Root Cause Generator] → [Action Planner]
                → [Markdown Generator] → [Postmortem Uploader]
```

* LangGraph is used to define each node as an agent or toolcaller
* State object includes: incident ID, metrics summary, user interaction
* Conditional logic: If confidence < threshold → re-run summarizer
* Output: Rich markdown + Slack-ready summary

💡 **Used By**: Fintech SRE teams and internal tools squads.

### 4. **Hybrid Orchestration (LangChain + LangGraph)**

| Layer     | Role                                                                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LangChain | Handles LLM chains, prompt templates, tools, retrievers                            |
| LangGraph | Controls state transitions, agent decision-making, retries, and flow orchestration |

**Example**:

* Use LangChain to build a retriever + summarizer pipeline.
* Use LangGraph to model 3 agents: `DataCollector`, `Summarizer`, `Validator`, with memory and condition-based flow.
